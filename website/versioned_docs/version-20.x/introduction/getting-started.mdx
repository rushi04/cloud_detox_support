# Getting Started

## Before You Start

### Overview of Detox

Detox is an open-source end-to-end (E2E) testing framework for React Native mobile applications.
Our main goal is to enable the testing of any end-to-end flow in the app, with maximum velocity and zero flakiness.
Detox tests your mobile app while it's running on a real device or simulator, simulating a real user's interactions.

### What Does a Detox Test Look Like?

This is a test for a login screen, it runs on a device or simulator like an actual user:

```js
describe('Login flow', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await device.reloadReactNative();
  });

  it('should login successfully', async () => {
    await element(by.id('email')).typeText('john@example.com');
    await element(by.id('password')).typeText('123456');

    const loginButton = element(by.text('Login'));
    await loginButton.tap();

    await expect(loginButton).not.toExist();
    await expect(element(by.label('Welcome'))).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Gray box testing

One of the most challenging aspects of automated testing on mobile is end-to-end testing.
UI testing frameworks are often not fully-deterministic, since they are built with a "black box" approach, where the test runner has no access to the internals of the app under test, and is unaware of asynchronous operations that take place in the app (such as network requests, animations, etc.).
This makes it difficult to write reliable E2E tests, and often leads to flaky tests that are hard to debug and maintain.

To address this issue, Detox adopts a "gray box" testing approach, by having access to the internals of the app under test.
This allows for more control and predictability in the testing process. For more information, you can read [how Detox works].

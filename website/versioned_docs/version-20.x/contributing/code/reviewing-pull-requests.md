# Review a Pull Request

Reviewing a PR is an important part of the contribution process. It ensures the quality of the codebase and provides an opportunity for the community to collaborate and learn from each other.

:::note

Reviewers should refer to the [Submitting Pull Requests] page to understand the guidelines the contributor followed when creating the PR. This will provide context and ensure a thorough review process.

## Understand the Changes

- Ensure alignment with the projectâ€™s coding standards and overall architecture.
- Read the provided description and any linked issues for context.

## Provide Constructive Feedback

Community members can provide valuable feedback on PRs, especially if they have experience with the feature or area of the codebase.

- Be respectful and courteous.
- Offer code snippet suggestions if something could be done better.
- Request changes if necessary and provide clear, constructive feedback.

## Review the Code

Experienced developers are encouraged to review PRs and provide feedback. This is a great way to learn more about the project and collaborate with the community.

You can review the code by following these requirements:

- Alignment with coding standards and architectural guidelines.
- Adequate test coverage (unit, integration, and e2e).
- Ensure the documentation reflects the changes in the PR, if necessary. Refer to the [Documentation Changes] page for guidelines.
- Meaningful and semantically correct commit messages.

## Merging Pull Requests

Every PR requires approval from a maintainer before it can be merged.

However, we encourage the community to review and provide feedback on PRs. Helping with the review process not only improves the quality of the code changes, but also helps the maintainers by reducing the workload.
